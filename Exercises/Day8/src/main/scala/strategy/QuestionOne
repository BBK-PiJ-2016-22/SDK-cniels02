a)
The strategy pattern is implemented through composition. It enables behaviour to be selected at run-time.
It consists of an interface that is set as a variable in the super class. This interface implements metods that allows
for a certain type of behaviour, that we want to extend the subclasses with.

b)
When different algorithms needs to be selected at runtime and an application needs to change behaviour based on
some selection criteria.
